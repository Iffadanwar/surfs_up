## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to understand temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii specifically in June and December. Understanding the weather will allow us to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
Using Data from hawaii.sqlite database, we were able to use SQLite and Pandas to find out key temperature information of the weather in June and December. We were able to then create Dataframes of the lists generated. Finally, we created a summary statistics that are shown below:

### June Temperature

### June Temperature

![Div 2.1](https://github.com/Iffadanwar/surfs_up/blob/main/images/Div%202.1.png)

- The results above show that the average weather temperature in June is ~75 degrees F and 4 degrees higher than December ~71 degrees F. This represents a (5.6%) decrease in the temperature as the year goes on. Since the temperature drop of only (%5.6), it shows a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round as the temperate weather stays above 70 f.
- The standard deviation of June is only 3.24f as compared to December's 3.74f deviation. This shows that June has a more stable temperature year-round. This also shows that the shop may be closed in some parts of the winter as weather may vary widely. 
- Despite averaging similar temperatures, December that a minimum temperature value of 56f making certain days too cold to operate the store.
- Minimum temperature value of June also can get chilly (64f) but the shop should still be operational all summer long. 

## Summary
As shown above, the temperature of June and December months vary slightly but not vastly enough to prevent the shop from opening year-round. The ice cream and surf shop would be an attraction to tourists and locals throughout the full year as both months are relatively warm.
- An additional query that would be beneficial to look up would be the proximity of the shop to the beach, as well as the precipitation and wind rates. Studying this will determine the perfect location to set up a shop that may remain open year-round.
- Lastly determining the location closest to the tourist hot spots on the island will be beneficial, Foot traffic on certain beaches as opposed to others as well and the stores' proximity to nearby towns will help greatly.
